# ZKP Age Verification

Decentralized zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system for age verification, built on the Casper blockchain.  
This project explores an alternative to centralized digital ID frameworks by providing a **privacy-preserving, verifiable method** for proving age without exposing personal data.

---

## 🚀 Overview
Current digital ID proposals often create risks of:
- Centralized control
- Data overreach
- Limited citizen choice  

This project aims to solve that by using **zero-knowledge proofs** to allow individuals to verify their age **without revealing their identity**. The goal is to create a framework that can scale across platforms, industries, and even countries.

---

## 🌐 Vision
- **Privacy-first:** Users should only prove what is necessary (e.g., 18+) without handing over sensitive information.  
- **Decentralized:** Powered by Casper, ensuring no single party (government, corporate, or platform) has control.  
- **Scalable:** Designed to integrate with websites, apps, and platforms globally.  
- **Interoperable:** Expandable to other verification types (citizenship, licenses, memberships).

## 🌍 Roadmap

The project will evolve in phases:

1. **Foundation (Q1):** Whitepaper, architecture, governance setup  
2. **Prototype (Q2):** Casper smart contracts (MVP) + testnet deployment  
3. **Demo App (Q3):** User/Verifier app + pilot platform integrations  
4. **Adoption (Q4):** Token utility, staking, broader partnerships  
5. **Scaling (Year 2+):** DAO governance, expanded proofs, global adoption
