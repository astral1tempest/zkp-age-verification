# Executive Summary

## Project Overview
We are building a **decentralized zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) age verification protocol** on the **Casper Network**.  
It allows users to prove they are above a required age (e.g., 16, 18, 21) **without revealing their date of birth or personal information**.  

This system addresses the growing demand for privacy-preserving compliance in social media, online gaming, gambling, and e-commerce.

---

## The Problem
- Current systems are **centralized and invasive**.  
- Users must repeatedly share sensitive ID data, creating risks of **breaches, surveillance, and misuse**.  
- Platforms face compliance pressures but lack a **global, interoperable, and privacy-first solution**.  

---

## Our Solution
- **ZK Proofs:** Users prove attributes like “age ≥ 18” without exposing DOB.  
- **Casper Smart Contracts:** Credential registry, verification, and revocation logic.  
- **User Wallets:** Proofs generated locally — no PII leaves the device.  
- **Verifiers:** Apps and platforms integrate lightweight verification APIs.  

---

## Token Utility
The protocol introduces a **native utility token** to align incentives:  
- **Verification Fees:** Paid in tokens by verifiers per proof.  
- **Staking:** Issuers and verifiers stake to participate; misbehavior is slashed.  
- **Incentives:** Early adopters and integrators earn rewards.  
- **Governance:** Token holders guide protocol upgrades, fees, and treasury use.  

---

## Roadmap Highlights
- **Q1:** Whitepaper + Casper contract prototypes.  
- **Q2:** Testnet token + staking framework.  
- **Q3:** Mainnet token launch + demo verifier app.  
- **Q4:** Pilot integrations with platforms; governance voting enabled.  
- **Year 2:** Expansion to global use cases and additional proof types.

## Key Benefits
- **Privacy-first:** No personal data shared.  
- **Decentralized trust:** Casper blockchain ensures security & transparency.  
- **Compliance-ready:** Meets regulatory needs without central ID control.  
- **Scalable:** Extensible to other verifications (citizenship, licenses, memberships).

## Conclusion
This project creates a **trustless, privacy-preserving alternative** to centralized digital ID checks.  
By combining **ZKPs + Casper**, we enable secure, global, and user-controlled age verification.
