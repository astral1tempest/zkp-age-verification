# üìç Adoption Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development and adoption plan for the **ZKP Age Verification on Casper** project.  
It is subject to iteration as community feedback, technical findings, and regulatory landscapes evolve.  

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Q1)
- ‚úÖ Create GitHub repository & initial documentation
- ‚úÖ Draft and publish whitepaper v1
- Define core architecture:
  - Component diagram
  - Sequence diagram
  - Technical modules (issuer, prover, verifier, Casper contracts)
- Establish governance repo and contribution guidelines

---

## Phase 2: Prototype (Q2)
- Write Casper-based smart contracts (MVP):
  - Credential Registry
  - Proof Verification Contract
  - Revocation List
- Develop test cases and deploy on **Casper Testnet**
- Begin security review of contract logic
- Create first **demo wallet** (CLI or lightweight UI)

---

## Phase 3: Demo App & Early Integrations (Q3)
- Build demo mobile/web app:
  - User credential storage (local/private)
  - Proof generation (ZKP)
  - Verifier-side integration flow
- Partner with **pilot platforms** (social app, online service, or test community)
- Conduct **usability testing** with early adopters
- Community feedback loop: refine contracts + UI

---

## Phase 4: Adoption & Token Utility (Q4)
- Launch **utility token** (for verification fees & staking)
- Introduce **staking mechanism**:
  - Issuers stake to ensure trustworthiness
  - Verifiers stake to prevent spam/fraud
- Expand adoption:
  - Cross-border and multi-jurisdictional use
  - Integration with existing digital wallets
- Prepare for **security audit** (external)

---

## Phase 5: Scaling & Governance (Beyond Year 1)
- Establish DAO-style governance for protocol upgrades
- Expand proofs beyond age ‚Üí **citizenship, license ownership, memberships**
- Partner with large-scale platforms (social, financial, e-commerce)
- Long-term goal: **global interoperability** with other decentralized ID standards

---

## Tracking Progress
- Roadmap items are linked to GitHub Issues & Pull Requests.
- ‚úÖ = completed  
- üöß = in progress  
- üîú = upcoming
