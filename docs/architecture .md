    participant U as "User Wallet and Prover"
    participant I as "Issuer"
    participant V as "Verifier App"
    participant C as "Casper Contracts"

    Note over U,I: Enrollment / Credential Issuance
    U ->> I: Present identity & DOB
    I ->> C: (optional) Register credential hash
    I ->> U: Issue signed credential

    Note over U,V: Age Proof without revealing DOB
    V ->> U: Request proof (age â‰¥ N)
    U ->> U: Generate ZK proof locally
    U ->> V: Send proof (no DOB/PII)
    V ->> C: Verify proof against registry
    C ->> V: Result valid/invalid
    V ->> U: Access granted/denied

    Note over I,C: Revocation
    I ->> C: Revoke or expire credential
    V ->> C: Check revocation at verification
