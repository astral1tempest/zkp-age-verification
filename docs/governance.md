# üèõ Governance Model

This document outlines the governance approach for the **ZKP Age Verification on Casper** project.  
The model will evolve as the project grows and community participation increases.  

---

## Current Model (Early Stage)
- **Maintainer-led governance**: The current repo maintainer coordinates development, roadmap decisions, and community input.  
- **Transparency**: All major decisions are discussed openly in GitHub Issues or Discussions.  
- **Contribution guidelines**: Defined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).  

---

## Transition Model (Mid Term)
As the project matures, governance will shift towards a **community-led structure**:
- **Working Groups**: Focused on areas like Smart Contracts, Wallets, Documentation, and Adoption.  
- **Voting Rights**: Contributors and token holders may participate in decision-making.  
- **Treasury Oversight**: Community involvement in how funds are allocated for development, incentives, and audits.  

---

## Long-Term Model (DAO)
The ultimate goal is to transition governance to a **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**:
- **Token-based voting** for proposals and upgrades.  
- **Elected stewards or councils** to manage day-to-day operations.  
- **On-chain treasury management** for ecosystem growth.  
- **Community-driven roadmap** with quarterly proposal cycles.  

---

## Principles
- **Open**: All discussions, proposals, and decisions are public.  
- **Inclusive**: Anyone may propose ideas or contribute.  
- **Secure**: Governance mechanisms will be audited to prevent abuse.  
- **Evolving**: Governance will adapt as adoption grows and new challenges arise.
