## How to Contribute

### 1. Issues

- Before opening a new issue, please check if it already exists.  
- Be clear and descriptive in your report.

### 2. Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.

- Link the PR to an existing issue if possible.  
- Write clear commit messages that explain *why* the change was made.

### 3. Documentation

- Update the roadmap or architecture diagrams if relevant.
