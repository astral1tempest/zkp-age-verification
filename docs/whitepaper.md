# Whitepaper: ZKP Age Verification on Casper

## üìå Abstract
This whitepaper proposes a decentralized zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system for age verification.  
The goal is to provide a **privacy-preserving, verifiable method** that allows individuals to prove they are above or below a required age without disclosing personal information.  

Built on the **Casper blockchain**, the system avoids centralized control and ensures scalability across industries and jurisdictions.

## üîç Introduction
Age verification is becoming an increasingly critical requirement for:  
- Social media and online platforms  
- Online marketplaces and gambling services  
- Adult content access  
- Financial services (KYC/AML compliance)  

Current methods rely heavily on **centralized digital ID systems** and data collection, which pose risks:  
- Data breaches  
- Government/corporate overreach  
- Limited citizen control over identity  

This project addresses those risks through a **decentralized architecture using ZKPs**.

## üè∑ Problem Statement
- **Centralized control**: Most age verification systems place control in governments or corporations.  
- **Privacy concerns**: Users must hand over ID, exposing sensitive data.  
- **Lack of interoperability**: Existing systems don‚Äôt scale globally across platforms.  
- **User exclusion**: Citizens without government-issued IDs are often excluded.  

---

## üí° Proposed Solution
A **zero-knowledge proof framework** where:  
- A user can prove they are **above a threshold age** (e.g., 18, 21) without sharing their date of birth or identity.  
- Verification happens through **smart contracts on Casper**, ensuring transparency and immutability.  
- The protocol is **modular** ‚Üí adaptable to other proofs (citizenship, license ownership, memberships).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture
- **Issuer**: Trusted authority (e.g., verified registrar) that provides ZKP credentials.  
- **User**: Holds credentials privately in a wallet.  
- **Verifier**: Platform or service requesting proof (e.g., social media, casino, online store).  
- **Casper smart contracts**: Manage verification logic, credential validity, and revocation.  
- **ZKP layer**: Generates and validates cryptographic proofs without exposing underlying data.

## üí∞ Tokenomics
The protocol introduces a **native utility token** to support trust, adoption, and decentralization.  

**Functions of the token**:  
1. **Verification Fees**: Paid by verifiers (apps, platforms) to process ZK proofs.  
2. **Staking**: Issuers and verifiers must stake tokens to ensure honest participation. Misbehavior ‚Üí slashing.  
3. **Incentives**: Early adopters, integrators, and developers earn token rewards for driving ecosystem growth.  
4. **Governance**: Token holders vote on protocol upgrades, age thresholds, fee models, and ecosystem grants.  
5. **Treasury Funding**: A portion of fees goes into a community-controlled treasury to fund ongoing development.  

**Supply & Distribution (example draft)**  
- Fixed total supply: **1B tokens**  
- 40% ecosystem (staking rewards, adoption incentives)  
- 20% development & grants  
- 20% community/DAO treasury  
- 10% team & advisors (vesting)  
- 10% reserve/liquidity

## üõ£ Adoption Roadmap
1. **Q1**: Draft & publish whitepaper; prototype Casper smart contracts (MVP).  
2. **Q2**: Launch testnet utility token; integrate staking for issuers/verifiers.  
3. **Q3**: Release demo app for user‚Äìverifier interaction; token mainnet launch.  
4. **Q4**: Partner with pilot platforms (social apps, online services); enable governance voting.  
5. **Year 2**: Expand cross-border adoption, wallet integrations, and incentivized programs.

## üèõ Governance & Community
- Open-source project hosted on GitHub.  
- Transparent development and feedback process.  
- Community-led governance with input from developers, issuers, and verifiers.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project aims to balance **privacy, compliance, and usability** in digital age verification.  
By leveraging **zero-knowledge proofs** and **Casper‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure**, it offers a scalable alternative to centralized digital ID systems.
